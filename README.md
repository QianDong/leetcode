# Algorithm Coding Exercises

### There are two branches so far: Easy and Daily Challenge.

"Easy" is a collection of coding excrises from Leetcode marked with "easy". I will add more excrises that I had done before to Github.

"Daily Challenge" is a collection of time limited challenge tasks that posted daily on leetcode.
